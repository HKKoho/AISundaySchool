      "character": "Abraham",
      "question": "God made a covenant with me, marked by a specific sign. What was this covenant primarily about?",
      "options": [
        "A promise of a new ship.",
        "A contract to build pyramids.",
        "A promise of land, descendants, and blessings.",
        "A decree to only eat vegetables."
      ],
      "explanation": "The Abrahamic Covenant (Genesis 12, 15, 17) was God's foundational promise. The sign of this covenant was circumcision, a physical mark symbolizing being set apart. This theme of 'being set apart' prefigures the concept of baptism.",
      "journalPrompt": {
        "title": "The Abrahamic Covenant",
        "content": "A covenant is a sacred promise. God promised Abraham land, countless descendants, and that all nations would be blessed through him. This laid the foundation for God's continuing relationship with humanity."
      },
      "deepDive": {
        "title": "Covenant Theology",
        "content": "In Hebrew, covenant is 'berit.' It's not merely a contract; it's a solemn oath that binds two parties together. Ancient covenants typically included a ceremony or sign, like circumcision. This concept of binding relational commitment is crucial for understanding later biblical themes, including the New Covenant established by Jesus."
      }
    },
    "q2": {
      "character": "Moses",
      "question": "At Mount Sinai, I received the Law for Israel, which included many purification rituals involving blood and water. What was the primary purpose of these rituals?",
      "options": [
        "To cleanse ritual impurity and restore the opportunity to approach God.",
        "To prepare for the annual swimming competition.",
        "To cool down in the desert heat.",
        "To wash clothes before festivals."
      ],
      "explanation": "The Law of Leviticus (Leviticus 11-15) prescribed washing with water or sacrificial blood to cleanse ritual impurity (e.g., after touching a corpse or suffering from skin diseases). This wasn't about physical dirt, but about being in a state of holiness to approach the holy God. Water and blood became powerful symbols of spiritual cleansing.",
      "journalPrompt": {
        "title": "Cleansing with Water",
        "content": "The Law given to Moses taught that God is holy, and people need to be cleansed to approach Him. Water was the primary means of this ritual purification, symbolizing the transition from an unclean state to a clean state."
      },
      "deepDive": {
        "title": "Ritual Purity vs. Moral Purity",
        "content": "It's important to distinguish between ritual impurity and sin. A person could become ritually impure without sinning. These laws taught Israel a profound lesson: approaching God requires holiness. Later prophets would emphasize that true inner purity matters more than external rituals, a theme that John the Baptist and Jesus would further develop."
      }
    },
    "q5": {
      "character": "Ezekiel",
      "question": "During the Babylonian exile, I conveyed God's promise to give His people a 'new heart' and a 'new spirit.' What did this promise primarily mean?",
      "options": [
        "An appreciation for new music styles.",
        "An inner, spiritual transformation enabling obedience to God.",
        "A physical heart transplant.",
        "The ability to learn new languages."
      ],
      "explanation": "Ezekiel 36:25-27 is a key Old Testament passage prophesying God's coming work of inner cleansing and renewal. God promised to cleanse His people with clean water, remove their 'heart of stone' (hardened heart), and give them a 'heart of flesh' (softened heart), placing His Spirit within them. This directly foreshadows the regeneration and indwelling of the Holy Spirit symbolized in Christian baptism.",
      "journalPrompt": {
        "title": "The Promise of a New Heart",
        "content": "The prophet Ezekiel foretold a new covenant that transcends external rituals. God promised to transform His people from deep within, cleansing them and giving them His Spirit to enable them to follow His ways."
      },
      "deepDive": {
        "title": "Rebirth in the Old Testament",
        "content": "While 'rebirth' is a New Testament concept, its roots are deeply planted in Old Testament promises. Passages like Ezekiel 36 and Jeremiah 31:31-34 (about the new covenant written on hearts) point to God's plan to do a fundamental work in human hearts. This is no longer just about following external laws, but having a transformed heart that desires to obey God. Christian baptism is the sign of this promise fulfilled."
      }
    },
    "q3": {
      "character": "John the Baptist",
      "question": "I baptized people in the Jordan River. My baptism was...",
      "options": [
        "A baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.",
        "Joining the local fishing club.",
        "An initiation into the Roman army.",
        "A meaningless cultural tradition."
      ],
      "explanation": "John's baptism was a powerful public declaration. People confessed their sins and turned to God, preparing for the coming Messiah. It connected the Old Testament theme of water purification with an urgent call for personal repentance.",
      "journalPrompt": {
        "title": "The Baptism of Repentance",
        "content": "John the Baptist was a bridge between the Old and New Testaments. His baptism in the Jordan River symbolized turning away from sin and preparing hearts for the coming of the Messiah, Jesus."
      },
      "deepDive": {
        "title": "Mikveh and John's Baptism",
        "content": "Jewish tradition already included ritual immersion in a 'mikveh' for purification. John's baptism was similar in form, but his message was radical, applying this ritual to all Israel as a sign of national repentance. He proclaimed that one greater than him was coming, who would baptize not just with water, but with the Holy Spirit and fire."
      }
    },
    "q4": {
      "character": "Apostle Peter",
      "question": "On the day of Pentecost, I told the crowd to 'repent and be baptized.' What was the purpose?",
      "options": [
        "To get a free meal.",
        "To cool down under the Jerusalem sun.",
        "For the forgiveness of your sins and to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.",
        "To register for a new community census."
      ],
      "explanation": "Peter's sermon in Acts 2 marked the birth of the Christian church. Baptism is now explicitly connected to faith in Jesus Christ, forgiveness of sins through His death and resurrection, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. This is the initiation rite into the New Covenant community.",
      "journalPrompt": {
        "title": "New Testament Baptism",
        "content": "Christian baptism, as proclaimed by Peter, is the culmination of salvation history. It combines the themes of covenant (joining God's people), cleansing (forgiveness of sins), and new life (receiving the Holy Spirit)."
      },
      "deepDive": {
        "title": "Baptism: Symbol of Union with Christ",
        "content": "The Apostle Paul later explained that baptism is spiritually dying, being buried, and rising with Jesus (Romans 6:3-4). When a person is immersed in water, it symbolizes the death of the old sinful self. Coming out of the water symbolizes resurrection to new life in Christ. This is a profound picture of the gospel itself."
      }
    },
    "q6": {
      "character": "Apostle Paul",
      "question": "In my letter to the Galatians, I mentioned that all who are baptized into Christ have 'clothed yourselves with Christ.' What is the spiritual meaning of this phrase?",
      "options": [
        "Wearing special clothing printed with Christ's image.",
        "In God's eyes, our identity is completely covered by Christ's righteousness.",
        "Joining a fashion club called 'Christ.'",
        "Getting a new cloak at baptism."
      ],
      "explanation": "'Clothed with Christ' (Galatians 3:27) is a powerful metaphor. It means that when we unite with Christ through faith and baptism, God no longer sees our sinful old self, but sees Christ's perfection and righteousness. Our identity is fundamentally changed. We are now 'in Christ,' with a new status and family.",
      "journalPrompt": {
        "title": "Clothed with Christ",
        "content": "Baptism is not just about washing away sins, but also putting on a new identity. The Apostle Paul taught that in baptism, we are clothed with Christ Himself. Our old identity has passed away, and we now live as God's children in Christ's righteousness."
      },
      "deepDive": {
        "title": "Identity in Christ",
        "content": "Central to Pauline theology is the concept of being 'in Christ.' This is a profound spiritual union. Baptism is the outward sign of this union. As Romans 6 explains, we died, were buried, and rose with Christ; as Galatians says, we are clothed with Him. This means Christ's victory becomes our victory, His righteousness becomes our righteousness, and His relationship with the Father becomes our relationship. This completely transforms how Christians see themselves and live."
      }
    },
    "q7": {
      "character": "Joshua",
      "question": "When the Israelites crossed the Jordan River into the Promised Land, I set up twelve stones as a memorial. What was the purpose of this monument?",
      "options": [
        "To build a swimming pool.",
        "To construct Joshua's new house.",
        "As a witness for future generations to ask about, commemorating God's miracle of drying up the river.",
        "To practice weightlifting exercises."
      ],
      "explanation": "Joshua 4:6-7 records that these twelve stones were set up so that when future children ask their meaning, parents could tell them how God stopped the waters of the Jordan River, allowing Israel to cross. This demonstrates the importance of commemorating God's deeds and passing down the story of faith.",
      "journalPrompt": {
        "title": "The Significance of Memorial Stones",
        "content": "The memorial stones that Joshua set up remind us that faith needs to be remembered and passed on. Every marker that witnesses God's deeds becomes an opportunity to tell the next generation about God's grace."
      },
      "deepDive": {
        "title": "Memory and Faith Transmission",
        "content": "The Old Testament is filled with examples of setting up memorials, from Jacob's stone pillar at Bethel to Samuel's Ebenezer stone. These are not merely historical records, but tools for faith education. They remind us of God's faithfulness and provide opportunities for the next generation to inquire and learn. The Christian practice of communion is also a continuation of this memorial tradition."
      }
    },
    "q8": {
      "character": "King David",
      "question": "I wrote in the Psalms: 'Cast your burden on the LORD.' What insight does this give us when facing life's difficulties?",
      "options": [
        "We should throw away all our luggage.",
        "We can entrust our worries and difficulties to God, trusting He will sustain us.",
        "We should move to another city.",
        "We need to hire more assistants."
      ],
      "explanation": "Psalm 55:22 teaches us that when facing overwhelming burdens and difficulties, we can entrust these to God. As a king, David experienced many challenges and learned to rely on God's strength rather than his own ability. This is a lesson in trust and surrender.",
      "journalPrompt": {
        "title": "The Wisdom of Surrender",
        "content": "David's Psalms teach us that true strength comes from learning to surrender. When we cast our burdens upon God, we are not escaping responsibility, but acknowledging God's sovereignty and care."
      },
      "deepDive": {
        "title": "The Theology of Trust in Psalms",
        "content": "David's Psalms are not only expressions of personal emotion, but also profound theological reflections. From the shepherd imagery in Psalm 23, to the repentance in Psalm 51, to the praise of God's omniscience in Psalm 139, these psalms teach us how to build a relationship with God in various life circumstances. Surrender is not passive resignation, but active trust."
      }
    },
    "q9": {
      "character": "King Solomon",
      "question": "When God asked me what I wanted, I didn't ask for wealth or long life, but for what?",
      "options": [
        "The power to defeat all enemies.",
        "A bigger palace.",
        "To become the richest person in the world.",
        "Wisdom to govern God's people."
      ],
      "explanation": "1 Kings 3:9 records that Solomon asked God to grant him wisdom so he could discern between good and evil and govern God's people well. This selfless request pleased God, who not only gave him wisdom but also wealth and honor. This teaches us the importance of priorities.",
      "journalPrompt": {
        "title": "The Value of Wisdom",
        "content": "Solomon's choice reminds us that true wisdom is more precious than any material wealth. When we seek God's wisdom, we are seeking the ability to live according to God's will."
      },
      "deepDive": {
        "title": "The Contribution of Wisdom Literature",
        "content": "Solomon not only ruled Israel with wisdom, but also left us rich wisdom literature, including Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and parts of Psalms. These books teach practical life wisdom, from interpersonal relationships to work ethics, from the power of words to the proper use of wealth. However, Ecclesiastes also reminds us that even the wisest person will find that life apart from God is ultimately meaningless."
      }
    },
    "q10": {
      "character": "Prophet Isaiah",
      "question": "I prophesied about a 'suffering servant' who would be 'pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities.' To whom does this prophecy point?",
      "options": [
        "The Messiah Jesus Christ.",
        "Assyrian King Sargon.",
        "Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar.",
        "Persian King Cyrus."
      ],
      "explanation": "Isaiah 53 is one of the clearest Messianic prophecies in the Old Testament. The description of this 'suffering servant' perfectly foretells the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The New Testament quotes this passage many times to demonstrate that Jesus is the promised Messiah.",
      "journalPrompt": {
        "title": "The Prophecy of the Suffering Servant",
        "content": "Isaiah's prophecy reveals to us that God's plan of redemption has been established since ancient times. The Messiah did not come as a conqueror, but as a suffering servant, saving the world through sacrifice."
      },
      "deepDive": {
        "title": "The Fulfillment of Messianic Prophecy",
        "content": "Isaiah 53 is called 'the Gospel of the Old Testament' because it so detailed foretells the Messiah's suffering, death, and victory. From 'Surely he took up our pain' to 'by his wounds we are healed,' every detail was fulfilled in Jesus. This prophetic fulfillment across hundreds of years is powerful evidence of the Bible's divine inspiration, and also shows us the depth and breadth of God's redemptive plan."
      }
    },
    "q11": {
      "character": "Daniel",
      "question": "In the Babylonian court, my friends and I decided not to eat the royal food and wine. What was the main reason for this?",
      "options": [
        "To uphold our faith in God and the requirements of the law.",
        "Because the food tasted bad.",
        "Because we were on a diet to lose weight.",
        "Because we wanted to be different."
      ],
      "explanation": "Daniel 1:8 records that Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine. This may have involved issues of whether the food was clean or offered to idols according to the law. Daniel maintained his faith in a foreign environment, demonstrating the courage to maintain spiritual loyalty under pressure.",
      "journalPrompt": {
        "title": "Maintaining Faith in a Foreign Land",
        "content": "Daniel's story reminds us that no matter what environment we are in, we can choose to be faithful to God. Even in an unfriendly environment, adhering to the right principles often brings unexpected blessings."
      },
      "deepDive": {
        "title": "Witness in Exile",
        "content": "The story of Daniel and his friends demonstrates how to live out faith in a secular environment. They did not escape the world, but became salt and light in the world. From refusing the royal food to being saved from the fiery furnace, from interpreting dreams to the miracle in the lions' den, these stories all illustrate one principle: when we are faithful to God, God is faithful to us. Their witness influenced foreign kings, demonstrating the transforming power of faith."
      }
    },
    "q12": {
      "character": "Jesus Christ",
      "question": "In the Sermon on the Mount, I said: 'Blessed are the poor in spirit.' What does 'poor in spirit' mean?",
      "options": [
        "People who speak very little.",
        "People who lack confidence.",
        "People in a bad mood.",
        "Those who recognize their spiritual poverty and need for God."
      ],
      "explanation": "In Matthew 5:3, 'poor in spirit' in the original language means 'poor in spirit.' This does not refer to material poverty, but to recognizing one's spiritual need, acknowledging that apart from God one has nothing. This humble attitude is the first characteristic of citizens of the kingdom of heaven.",
      "journalPrompt": {
        "title": "Poverty in Spirit",
        "content": "Jesus' Beatitudes begin with poverty in spirit, reminding us that the first step to entering the kingdom of heaven is recognizing our need. When we acknowledge our limitations and sinfulness, we prepare our hearts to receive God's grace."
      },
      "deepDive": {
        "title": "The Values of the Kingdom",
        "content": "The Beatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount completely overturn the world's values. The world says the strong are blessed, Jesus says the poor in spirit are blessed; the world says the rich are blessed, Jesus says those who mourn are blessed. These teachings are not a negative life philosophy, but the positive values of the kingdom of heaven. They describe a new way of life, built on trust in God and love for others."
      }
    },
    "q13": {
      "character": "Tax Collector Zacchaeus",
      "question": "After Jesus came to my house, what did I do to demonstrate true repentance?",
      "options": [
        "I gave half my possessions to the poor and repaid fourfold what I had extorted.",
        "I resigned from my tax collector job.",
        "I moved to another city.",
        "I built a new synagogue."
      ],
      "explanation": "Luke 19:8 records that Zacchaeus said to the Lord: 'Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.' This was not just verbal repentance, but concrete action, showing that true repentance brings changes in lifestyle.",
      "journalPrompt": {
        "title": "The Fruit of Repentance",
        "content": "Zacchaeus' story tells us that true repentance is not just an internal change, but is expressed in external actions. When we truly encounter Jesus, both our values and behaviors are transformed."
      },
      "deepDive": {
        "title": "Salvation and Social Justice",
        "content": "Zacchaeus' story beautifully combines personal salvation with social justice. He was not satisfied with just obtaining peace of mind, but proactively repaired the harm his past wrongful actions had caused others. This shows that the true gospel is holistic; it not only saves souls, but also transforms our attitudes toward wealth, power, and relationships. Zacchaeus' actions respond to the Old Testament teachings about justice and mercy."
      }
    },
    "q14": {
      "character": "Apostle John",
      "question": "In the Gospel of John, I recorded Jesus saying 'I am the way, the truth, and the life.' What is the core message of this statement?",
      "options": [
        "Jesus knows many truths.",
        "Jesus is a great philosophy teacher.",
        "Jesus is the best travel guide.",
        "Jesus is the only way to the Father."
      ],
      "explanation": "John 14:6 fully records Jesus' words: 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.' This is the core declaration of the Christian faith, explaining that Jesus is not just one of many religious leaders, but the only mediator between God and humanity.",
      "journalPrompt": {
        "title": "The Uniqueness of Christ",
        "content": "This statement recorded by John challenges us to think about Jesus' identity. He did not say He knows the way, but that He is the way. This exclusive claim demands our response: to accept or reject."
      },
      "deepDive": {
        "title": "The 'I Am' Declarations in John's Gospel",
        "content": "John's Gospel records seven 'I am' declarations by Jesus: the bread of life, the light of the world, the gate for the sheep, the good shepherd, the resurrection and the life, the way truth and life, the true vine. These declarations all use the 'I am' format of God's self-revelation in the Old Testament (such as Exodus 3:14), implying Jesus' divinity. Each declaration is not just a metaphor, but a profound theological statement about Jesus' nature."
      }
    },
    "q15": {
      "character": "Martha",
      "question": "When I was busy serving and complained about my sister Mary, what did Jesus say to me?",
      "options": [
        "You should hire more servants.",
        "Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.",
        "You both should go to the kitchen to help.",
        "You don't need to prepare such a lavish meal."

      "explanation": "The Vulgate is the Latin Bible translation completed by Church Father Jerome between 382-405 CE. He translated the Old Testament from Hebrew (rather than relying on LXX) and revised the New Testament Latin translation. The Vulgate became the Catholic Church's official Bible version for over a thousand years, until after Vatican II when use of vernacular languages was encouraged.",

      "deepDive": {
        "title": "Historical Influence of the Vulgate",
        "content": "Vulgate characteristics: 1) Translated Old Testament from Hebrew, not relying on LXX (Jerome learned Hebrew in Bethlehem); 2) Includes Deuterocanonical books; 3) Influenced Western theological vocabulary (like 'sacramentum' = sacrament). The Council of Trent (1546) declared the Vulgate the official version, responding to Protestant Reformers' Greek/Hebrew original text movement. Vulgate influence: all medieval theology and worship; English vocabulary (many KJV translations derive from Vulgate); art and literature (Dante, Milton). In 1979, the Nova Vulgata became the Catholic liturgical version."

      "explanation": "The Intertestamental Period (also called the '400 Silent Years') experienced Persian, Greek (Alexander and his successors), and Roman rule. This period saw the formation of Jewish sects mentioned in the New Testament, the synagogue system, scribal traditions, heightened Messianic expectations, and Hellenistic cultural influence.

Persecutions: Nero (64 AD), Domitian (90s AD), Trajan (110s AD), Diocletian (303 AD). Constantine (313 AD) issued the Edict of Milan, ending persecution."

Key differences: 1) Monotheism vs. polytheism; 2) Orderly creation vs. violent divine conflict; 3) Humans in God's image vs. slaves of gods; 4) Moral flood judgment vs. gods annoyed by human noise; 5) Loving Creator vs. capricious gods.

      "explanation": "The first century was an honor-shame culture (collectivist, valuing public opinion), not modern Western guilt culture (individualist, valuing inner conscience). Understanding this helps explain: Jesus' 'poor in spirit' and 'persecuted for righteousness' (Matt 5:3,10), the 'shame' of the cross (Heb 12:2), Paul's 'boasting' rhetoric (2 Cor 10-12), exhortations to mutual submission (Eph 5:21).",

New Testament examples: Prodigal son parable (Luke 15, younger son shames family); Zacchaeus (Luke 19, tax collector profession shameful); Cross (Deut 21:23, one hung is cursed); Women witnesses (John 20, women's testimony not valued in honor-shame culture, but God chooses them).

Contribution: helps understand Gospel material diversity and early church context. Criticism: 1) Excessive skepticism about historical reliability; 2) Assumes community created rather than preserved tradition; 3) Ignores eyewitness role. Conservative scholars like Richard Bauckham emphasize eyewitness testimony and apostolic authority."

Examples: 1) Matthew's five major discourses (chs 5-7, 10, 13, 18, 24-25) echo the Pentateuch, showing Jesus as the new Moses; 2) Luke-Acts' journey theme (Luke 9:51 'set his face toward Jerusalem,' Acts 1:8 'to the ends of the earth'); 3) John's 'I am' declarations and 'believe' verb (John 20:30-31).

Focus texts: Gen 2-3 (Eve), Judg 4-5 (Deborah), Prov 31 (virtuous woman), Luke 1-2 (Mary and Elizabeth), Rom 16 (deacon Phoebe), 1 Cor 11 and 14 (women in church), Gal 3:28 (unity in Christ), Eph 5 (husband-wife relationship), 1 Tim 2 (women teaching).

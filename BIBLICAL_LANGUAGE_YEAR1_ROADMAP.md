## 💡 Next Steps

1. **Review this roadmap** - Do you agree with the priorities?
2. **Choose starting point** - Which Phase/Priority should we implement first?
3. **Define scope** - Full Year 1 or start with subset?
4. **Set timeline** - How quickly do you want to build this?

**My Recommendation:** Start with **Phase 1 - Vocabulary Flashcard System** as it's the most critical gap and provides immediate value.

Would you like me to start implementing any specific feature from this roadmap?
